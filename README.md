# vegMonitor

This is a project which summarizes remote sensing data post-processing in order to extract key vegetation data. This repository is still under processing and will soon be combined with the [GEEBulkFilter](https://github.com/AtreyaSh/GEEBulkFilter) repository in a Jupyter notebook. Stay tuned for more!
