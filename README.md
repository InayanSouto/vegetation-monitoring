# Investigating vegetation cover changes in Dharamshala Tehsil, Northwestern Indian Himalayas, from 2013-2017

This is a project which summarizes remote sensing data processing techniques in order to extract key vegetation data and indications about vegetation changes.

## Background and Objectives

The study area of this project is [Dharamshala Tehsil](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dharamshala), located in the Indian state of Himachal Pradesh. This region is famous for its natural and cultural beauty. Intense tourism and development in recent years has allegedly led to a large loss of local forest cover. In order to conduct an independent investigation of these changes, we suggest here a set of methodologies based on public remote-sensing data.

The end of goal of this project is to generate vegetation cover classification images of the study area from 2013-2017. With this images, we aim to develop a change detection technique that would indicate to us regions undergoing significant vegetation loss. These regions would then be flagged for further investigation. 

## Guide to Methodologies

### Bulk Filter Remote Sensing Data using Google Earth Engine

Firstly, we need to download relevant remote-sensing data for our purpose. The Google Earth Engine (GEE) provides an efficient means of bulk filtering data before finally downloading it. Here, we choose to download the Landsat 8 Surface Reflectance data. 

1. To start this process, a Google account is necessary. Next, one needs to sign up for GEE. If this is not done as yet, navigate to the following site to sign up:

   https://earthengine.google.com/

2. After signing up for GEE, log into your account within GEE and navigate to the central code editor. Create a new repository and name it accordingly.
