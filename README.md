# Assessing vegetation cover changes in the Northwestern Indian Himalayas from 2013-2017

This is a project which summarizes remote sensing data processing techniques in order to extract key vegetation data and indications about vegetation changes.

## Background and Objectives

The study area of this project is [Dharamshala Tehsil](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dharamshala), located in the Indian state of Himachal Pradesh. This region is famous for its natural and cultural beauty. Intense tourism and development in recent years has allegedly led to a large loss of local forest cover. In order to conduct an independent investigation of these changes, we suggest here a set of methodologies based on public remote-sensing data.

The end of goal of this project is to generate vegetation cover classification images of the study area from 2013-2017. With this images, we aim to develop a change detection technique that would indicate to us regions undergoing significant vegetation loss. These regions would then be flagged for further investigation.
